# final project 
The game is THI3F and ultimately the goal is to collect as much money as possible in the time given while still being able to make it to the get away car. If you run out of time on any level you automatically lose and in order for the money to be counted for your score is to get to the get away car at the end. Avoid cops at all costs. If you get caught you also lose.
